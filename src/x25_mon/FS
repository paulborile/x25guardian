Functional Spec
---------------

x25_mon : Monitor x25 physical lines and report status changes to sm_mgr.

- Read sync.tab and foreach physical line issue a dummy x25listen just
  to obtain a cid.
- on a time basis issue x25linkstats to get statistics about the link.
  When the link goes down use sm_set_route(host, link, type, newstatus)
  to notify the status manager that the link has gone down. No routing
  will take place for a link which is down.

Ideas for the logging of incoming calls :

Each machine has is own log directory.

Ex: router/x25.log-??

date     lk vc nua          msg
17:14:51 01 08 226002871516 INCOMING CALL TO 9000111 PID EASYWAY
17:14:53 01 07 226002871516 INCOMING CALL TO 9000111 PID EASYWAY


vc : obtainable from x25status(cid, buffer);
lk : Is the port number which may be from 1 to 48 or from FF to D0
